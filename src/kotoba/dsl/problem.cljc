(ns kotoba.dsl.problem
  "Shared validation problem helpers for portable kotoba DSL libraries.

  A problem is plain EDN with namespaced keys:
  {:<domain>/severity :error|:warn
   :<domain>/code     keyword
   :<domain>/id|path  subject
   :<domain>/msg      string}

  AUTHORITY AND LOAD PATH (ADR 0001, amended 2026-08-13 by ADR-2608130900).

  `src/kotoba/dsl/problem.kotoba` remains the semantic authority: it is the
  sovereign Kotoba program, it declares no effects, and it is what the typed
  ABI, restricted-JavaScript and typed-Wasm conformance tests execute.

  This `.cljc` is the *load path*. Consumers (`policy`, `statechart`, `torch`,
  `org-w3-rdf`, … — eleven repos at the time of writing) `(:require
  [kotoba.dsl.problem :as problem])` from JVM Clojure, ClojureScript and nbb,
  and no Clojure loader can require a `.kotoba` file. Between 2026-07-21 and
  2026-08-13 this file did not exist and every one of those consumers was
  unloadable on every runtime; see ADR-2608071000. The rule that came out of
  that (ADR-2608071000 decision 1) is that a `.kotoba` migration removes the
  `.cljc` only after consumers have a load path — so the `.cljc` comes back and
  stays until the guest itself is loadable.

  The two are held in agreement by `test/kotoba/dsl/problem_parity_test.clj`,
  which compiles the `.kotoba` and executes it through the KIR interpreter in
  the same JVM, then compares its typed documents against this namespace's EDN
  encoded into the same document form. Follows `kotoba-lang/css`, where
  `css.core` likewise stayed put behind a parity gate.

  DELIBERATE DIVERGENCES from the guest, all of them properties of the guest's
  execution sandbox rather than of the semantics:

  - Resource bounds. The guest is bounded by the KIR document budget (32 items
    per container, 256 nodes, depth 8, 64 KiB of text). This namespace is not.
    A validator that emits 40 problems is representable here and is not
    representable as one document; the parity gate therefore asserts agreement
    only inside the guest's bounds, and says so.
  - Failure mechanism. Where the guest fails closed by trapping (and surfaces
    as `ExceptionInfo` at the execution boundary), this namespace throws
    `ex-info` directly. Both refuse; neither returns a wrong answer.
  - Collection identity. `errors`/`warnings` return a Clojure vector here and a
    document vector there. Same elements, same order.

  API SURFACE. The `.kotoba` exports
  `severities domain-key problem problem-field severity error? warning? errors
  warnings valid?` and all of them are provided here. `problem` additionally
  keeps its six-argument subject-key overload, which `kotoba-lang/torch` calls
  (`torch/validate.cljc:13`) and which the guest expresses as `problem-field`."
